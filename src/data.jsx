    brief: [
      "TracFone Wireless, subsidiary of the largest Mexican telecommunications companies - América Móvil, is a leading provider of prepaid mobile phone services in the United States.

Creating a seamless and intuitive user experience enhances customer satisfaction, promotes self-service capabilities, and ultimately improves customer retention.",
      "The project involves close collaboration with cross-functional teams, including designers, developers, and quality assurance professionals, to ensure the successful implementation of the My Account capability. Through development, thorough testing, and gathering user feedback, we will deliver a reliable and feature-rich solution that aligns with business objectives and solves customer pain points.",
